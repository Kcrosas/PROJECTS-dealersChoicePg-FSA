# Dealer's Choice

## Homework due 11/10/21

### Kenneth Rosas - Junior Phase - Cohort 2110

This is a Postgres refactored version of the previous homework "Dealer's Choice"

## Plan

1. Disconnect/Stop use of products.js (especially the data in the predefined array) and create/pull data from postgres database
2. Restyle refactored code back to original website style
3. Restructure file tree to something more manageable

## Changes to Plan

1. HW goal met: PG refactor is complete but style is limited on product page.
2. Will continue to work on this when time is available to restyle and restructure files

## Image source

1. Banner image from unknown wallpaper site
2. Motorcycle images are all from ebay
